About
=====

The Stratio Connector-HDFS allows `Stratio Crossdata <http://docs.stratio.com/modules/crossdata/0.4/index.html>`__ to interact with HDFS.

Requirements
------------

`Crossdata <http://docs.stratio.com/modules/crossdata/0.4/index.html>`__ is needed to interact with this connector.

rpm is needed to generate executable connector. You can install it as follow:
::

 > sudo apt-get install rpm

Compiling Stratio Connector-HDFS
--------------------------------

To automatically build execute the following commands:

::

       > mvn clean compile install


Running the Stratio Connector-HDFS
----------------------------------

To run Stratio Connector-HDFS execute in the parent directory:

::

       > ./connector-hdfs/target/stratio-connector-hdfs/bin/stratio-connector-hdfs


Build a redistributable package
-------------------------------

It is possible too, to create a RPM or DEB package, as :

::

    > mvn package -Ppackage

Once the package itâ€™s created, execute this commands to install:

RPM Package:

::

    > rpm -i target/stratio-connector-hdfs-[version].rpm

DEB Package:

::

    > dpkg -i target/stratio-connector-hdfs-[version].deb

Now to start/stop the connector:

::

    > service stratio-connector-hdfs start

    > service stratio-connector-hdfs stop


How to use Stratio Connector-HDFS
---------------------------------

A complete tutorial is available `here <http://docs.stratio.com/modules/stratio-connector-hdfs/0.5/First_Steps.html>`__. The
basic commands are described below.

1. Start `Stratio Crossdata Server and then Stratio Crossdata Shell <http://docs.stratio.com/modules/crossdata/0.4/index.html>`__.

2. Start Stratio Connector-HDFS as it is explained before.

3. In the Stratio Crossdata Shell:

   Attach a cluster on that datastore:

   ::

   > xdsh:user>  ATTACH CLUSTER <cluster_name> ON DATASTORE <datastore_name> WITH OPTIONS {'highavailability': 'true', 'path':'Base_path_to_HDFS_root_directory'};``

   Attach the connector to the previously defined cluster. The connector
   name must match the one defined in the Connector Manifest.

   ::

   > xdsh:user>  ATTACH CONNECTOR <connector name> TO <cluster name> WITH OPTIONS {};


At this point, we can start to send queries in the Stratio Crossdata Shell.
