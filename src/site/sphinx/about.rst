Native connector for HDFS using Crossdata.

Requirements
------------

`Stratio HDFS <https://github.com/Stratio/stratio-connector-hdfs>`__
must be installed and started. [Crossdata]
(https://github.com/Stratio/crossdata) is needed to interact with this
connector.

Compiling Stratio Connector HDFS
--------------------------------

To automatically build execute the following command:

::

       > mvn clean compile install

Build an executable Connector HDFS
----------------------------------

To generate the executable, execute the following command:

::

       > mvn crossdata-connector:install

It is possible to add new special HDFS configuration:

The file called HDFSDataStore.xml contains some properties. The
"Partitions" variable could be set to two different configurations:

Set this variable to "DiferentPartitions" in the ConnectorClusterConfig
options to create a HDFS structure with different file partitions of the
data table:

::

    catalog/table/partition1.xxx
                 /partition2.xxx
                 /partition3.xxx
                 

Set this variable to "OnePartition" in the ConnectorClusterConfig
options to create a HDFS structure with one file partition of the data
table;

::

    catalog/metaFile.xxx
           /table1.xxx
           

In order to specify the partition sequence use the "PartitionName"
variable in the configuration options. In order to specify the extension
of the files use the "Extension" variable in the configuration options.

Running the Stratio Connector HDFS
----------------------------------

To run HDFS Connector execute:

::

       > mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.stratio.connector.hdfs.connection.HDFSConnector"

How to use HDFS Connector
-------------------------

A complete tutorial is available `here <_doc/FirstSteps.md>`__. The
basic commands are described below.

1. Start `crossdata-server and then
   crossdata-shell <https://github.com/Stratio/crossdata>`__.
2. https://github.com/Stratio/crossdata
3. Start HDFS Connector as it is explained before
4. In crossdata-shell:

   Add a datastore with this command. We need to specified the XML
   manifest that defines the data store. The XML manifest can be found
   in the path of the HDFS Connector in
   target/stratio-connector-hdfs-0.2.0/conf/HDFSDataStore.xml

   ``xdsh:user>  ADD DATASTORE <Absolute path to HDFS Datastore manifest>;``

   Attach cluster on that datastore. The datastore name must be the same
   as the defined in the Datastore manifest.

   ``xdsh:user>  ATTACH CLUSTER <cluster_name> ON DATASTORE <datastore_name> WITH OPTIONS {'Hosts': '[<IPHost_1,IPHost_2,...,IPHost_n>]', 'Port': '[<PortHost_1,PortHost_2,...,PortHost_n>]'};``

   Add the connector manifest. The XML with the manifest can be found in
   the path of the HDFS Connector in
   target/stratio-connector-hdfs-0.2.0/conf/HDFSConnector.xml

   ``xdsh:user>  ADD CONNECTOR <Path to HDFS Connector Manifest>``

   Attach the connector to the previously defined cluster. The connector
   name must match the one defined in the Connector Manifest.

   ::

       ```
           xdsh:user>  ATTACH CONNECTOR <connector name> TO <cluster name> WITH OPTIONS {};
       ```

   At this point, we can start to send queries.

   ::

       ...
           xdsh:user> CREATE CATALOG catalogTest;

           xdsh:user> USE catalogTest;

           xdsh:user> CREATE TABLE tableTest ON CLUSTER hdfs_prod (id int PRIMARY KEY, name text);

       ...
